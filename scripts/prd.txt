# Product Requirements Document: Mortgage Market Analysis Tool

## Overview
The Mortgage Market Analysis Tool is a data analysis application that combines swap rate data with ESIS (European Standardised Information Sheet) data to calculate premium over swap rates for mortgage products across the market. The tool will enable Generation Home's Chief Commercial Officer to analyze mortgage pricing trends by visualizing loan amounts categorized by premium bands and time periods, supporting strategic pricing decisions.

## Problem Statement
Generation Home needs to analyze how its mortgage products are priced relative to market swap rates compared to competitors. Currently, this requires manual data processing to:
1. Match ESIS data with corresponding swap rates
2. Calculate premiums over swap rates
3. Aggregate loan amounts by premium bands and time periods
4. Analyze trends and market positioning

An automated tool would significantly reduce analysis time and enable more frequent and detailed market assessments.

## User Personas
**Primary User:** Chief Commercial Officer at Generation Home
- Needs to make strategic pricing decisions
- Has high financial literacy and familiarity with mortgage market concepts
- Requires actionable insights rather than just raw data

**Secondary Users:** Pricing analysts and commercial team members
- Support the CCO with data-driven recommendations
- Need to perform ad-hoc analyses on market positioning

## Goals and Success Metrics
1. Reduce time spent on manual data processing by 90%
2. Enable more frequent (weekly vs. monthly) market position analyses
3. Improve pricing strategy with data-driven insights
4. Identify market opportunities in specific premium bands
5. Track Generation Home's competitive position over time

## Input Requirements
The tool will accept two CSV files:

**1. Swap Rates Dataset**
- Fields: product_term_in_months, rate, effective_at
- Contains swap rates for various terms with corresponding effective dates
- Example format shown in the provided sample data

**2. ESIS Dataset**
- Fields: DocumentDate, BaseLender, Description, Type, Loan, LTV, InitialFees, ProductType, TieInPeriod, InitialRate, PurchaseType
- Contains mortgage offer details from various lenders
- Example format shown in the provided sample data

## Detailed Specifications

### Premium Band Calculation
- Create premium bands starting from the lowest premium with any data
- Use consistent 20 basis point bands (e.g., 100-120 bps, 120-140 bps)
- Display bands as rows in the analysis table

### Date Matching Logic
- Match ESIS DocumentDate with the closest preceding swap rate effective_at date
- For ESIS records with no matching swap rate date, use the closest available rate
